# Playbook

## Introduction
### Purpose

For most of dxw's life, we've been small enough that it's been easy for everyone to know what's going on and how to get things done, just by listening to what's going on in the office. That's not the case anymore. We're now at the point where we need a reference for the way we do things. A place to capture the changes we agree to make. Something canonical that tells us what the current "right way" to do things is.

We'll always iterate on this document. It will never be complete or entirely correct, and we always explore better ways to get things done. But now, when we've found one, it'll be recorded here. And once it is, it'll be the way we do things until we find something better.

This document lives in Github. Anyone on the team can edit it, and should do so. But an edit must never be a substitute for discussion and agreement, so be careful about making significant changes. This document is also public, because there is very little about our process that cannot be open. But there will be things from time to time, so don't forget that changes here get published to the world.

Finally, this document is inspired by [Thoughtbot's excellent playbook](https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/), some of which we have made our own. Thanks, Thoughtbot!

### Why are we all here?

The web has revolutionised the way society works. Most of society has reaped the benefits of digital technology, but most public services lag behind. As a result, they are often expensive, and not very good. 

Since dxw was founded in 2008, a lot of things have become better. The Government Digital Service has changed the conversation about how and why services get built, and many are much better as a result. But the challenge facing the public sector is not one that any organisation could tackle alone. 

In addition to talented in-house teams who understand how to deliver great services, the public sector needs talented suppliers who understand how to work with it. And who are driven by a desire to make public services better. And who understand how to combine a modern technogical approach with agile principles of development and user-centricity. That's what dxw is here to do.

We build digital public services that are flexible, efficient, effective and useful. We want people's experience of those services to be straightforward, positive and seamless. We believe that in building those services using agile principles, we can help government to embed those same principles in other parts of their organisations. We hope to help government become associated with technological excellence.

We can help the public sector to spend less on technology so that it can spend more on education, healthcare, policing and welfare. We believe that it is possible to use technology and agile principles to help government become something recognisably, radically better: and we want to help make it happen.

### Values

We think that it's very important to have a talented team if we're going to succeed. But just as important as raw talent is our ability to work well together. These are the values that we aspire to, and help each other to achieve.

#### Helpful
We are helpful, useful and expert. We give practical and pragmatic advice to each other, and to our clients.

#### Honest
We are honest, trustworthy and straightforward. We give plain-spoken, frank, accurate feedback and advice, and we never mislead or obfuscate.

#### Positive
We are positive, cheerful and supportive. Even in crisis, we stay optimistic. We [assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith) and offer constructive challenge.

#### Creative
We are creative, diverse and curious. We help each other to learn and improve and we're sensitive to each others' needs. We love technology and finding new ways to solve problems.

#### Determined
We are determined, discerning and motivated. We believe in high standards, we enjoy doing things properly, and we're loath to settle for less.

#### Reliable
We are reliable, consistent and committed. We make every effort to live up to each others' expectations, and to exceed the expectations of our clients.  

### Some guiding principles

#### Agile mindset
#### Sustainable pace
#### Openness

### Changes to this document
This playbook is a collaborative effort. If you spot something that's wrong, feel free to hop in and correct it. But remember that this playbook is the result of our conversations about how we should do things, not a substitute for one. So don't make changes unless they reflect our shared agreement about how things are going to be done.

If you are making a substantial change (perhaps following a team conversation) please make it in a branch and submit a pull request. Then ask someone else who was in the conversation to review and merge it. When we review a pull request on the playbook, we check that it accurately captures the conversation, that it doesn't contain anything private, and that it's well written and free of typos, incorrect speelings and other minor errors.

## Tickets
We use [Zendesk](https://dxw.zendesk.com) to manage support requests. If you're just getting started, the [Zendesk Introduction](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203921213) is your first port of call. After you've read that, ask someone to sit with you and talk you through it, to answer any questions.

Other than for projects you're currently sprinting on, all requests for us to do things must come via tickets. We use tickets to manage requests in order to:

* Keep track of all the things we need to do, and what state they're in;
* Have a record of the changes we're asked to make;
* Ensure that we only accept change requests from people who are authorised;
* Generate data about how much staff time is spent on each client's issues.

If a client asks us to do something in person or on the phone, we politely ask them to visit http://dxw.zendesk.com/ instead, and submit a ticket there. If they send a request via email, we forward their email to support@dxw.com to turn it into a ticket.

We do not do any work at all on a client site unless we are on a sprint or working on a relevant ticket. This is really important.

### Client experience

#### Responsiveness
Clients expect us to deal with their issues promptly. But they understand that this isn't always possible. They are generally forgiving of the fact that we're sometimes busy, and they understand that some issues are complex and require long investigations.

The thing most clients value above all else is being kept informed of what is going on. The first quality of a good ticket experience is responsiveness: we keep clients informed of what we're doing, even if there hasn't been much progress.

#### Sticking to commitments
It's really important that we do what we say we'll do, and don't promise things we can't deliver. If we're unable to deal with a ticket in good time and leave an update saying we'll work on it tomorrow, we must meet that commitment. 

It is doubly bad to fail to meet a commitment and not say anything about it. Responsiveness is always the priority. So if for some reason we couldn't do what we said we'd do, we always respond to say so.

#### Make a good impression
In tickets as in all things, we are mindful of dxw's [values](#Values).

Most clients' routine contact with us is via support tickets. So it's vital that our clients' experience of the support system is a good one, and also that they have a positive experience with us personally.

So, we are always considerate, and think about what style of response is best. For example, technical clients may appreciate short, information-dense responses, while non-technical clients might perceive that style as rude or dismissive.

In general:

* We are personable, friendly and helpful
* If things look like they're going to get difficult, or the client seems unhappy, we are honest, and assume good faith
* If appropriate, we are apologetic. If we screw something up, we take responsibility and apologise. If the client seems very upset, we let a delivery manager know.
* If we do become annoyed or frustrated by a ticket, we respond later or reassign it.


#### Don't over-deliver

Of course, every client would like us to go the extra mile to solve their problem. But they also understand that to do that for them would mean bad service for another client - or that we never get to their issue, because we're too busy gold-plating the solution to someone else's.

While we do everything we can to make sure the client is happy with our solution, we are also mindful of what's practical. We don't do serious bits of development work on tickets, or trial new approaches. We don't play with new tools or sink hours into interesting bugs. We set those things aside, and do them later.

The main purpose of a ticket is to take some action that solves the problem, as quickly as possible. Generally speaking, we do the most time-efficient thing that we can. Of several potential solutions that solve the problem, assuming none is a bad one, we do the one which can be implemented the most quickly.


### Workflow

All tickets that arrive on the helpdesk go through a number of stages in the course of being worked on.


#### New tickets

When a new ticket arrives, it is automatically assigned to the Front-line Support group. All agents in this group receive an email to alert them. 

If you are in the Front-line Support group, it's important that you keep an eye on the helpdesk so that you know when new tickets arrive. It's your responsibility to review tickets as they arrive, and decide what to do with them. If you can deal with the issue, or if you can complete an initial investigation into the problem, do so.

If you're ultimately unable to solve the ticket, assign it to someone in the Escalated Support group. Try to choose the person you think will be best placed to solve the issue. If you're not sure, ask a delivery manager.


#### Assignments

No matter what group you're in, when a ticket is assigned to you, you will receive an email. The ticket will also appear on your home screen in Zendesk.

When you are assigned a ticket, it is your responsibility to review it and take action. You must either solve the ticket or pass it on to someone who can. 

A wide variety of issues can be reported through the helpdesk, so it's not possible to give an exhaustive guide on how to solve tickets. But there are some articles in the [Help Centre](https://dxw.zendesk.com) which may be useful. These are written for clients, but contain lots of useful information.

It's important to be proactive about solving tickets. As soon as we receive a ticket, the clock starts ticking: clients expect us to be [responsive](#Responsiveness) and deal with their problems promptly.

If we're not sure how to proceed with a particular ticket, we don't just let it sit there: we ask for help. If we know what to do but don't have time to get it done, we get advice from a delivery manager.

Whenever we do anything at all related to a given ticket, we update it to let the client know - even if it's just to say that we haven't managed to figure out what the problem is yet. 

If we're replying to a ticket just to update the client, but we still need to take some action, we set its status to open. The same applies if you are reassigning the ticket to another agent.

If we have taken some action and are now waiting for the client to reply, we set the ticket's status to pending. This will remove it from the list of tickets (until they answer).

#### Pending tickets

Pending tickets are those which we have updated with a question or a potential solution, and which now need to be updated by the client before we can proceed.

Pending tickets will not appear in the list of tickets or in the views for the Front-line and Escalated groups, allowing us to focus on tickets which still need your action.

Tickets which are pending will also be closed automatically after a set period of time if the client does not respond. They will get reminders before this happens. If a pending ticket you are assigned to is closed because the client didn't reply in time, both you and the client will get an email, so you can open it again if you think that's best.

When assigning a ticket to another agent, we do not set it to pending, otherwise they probably won't see it.


#### Solving tickets

If we believe that we have solved the issue the client has raised, we submit it as solved.

If it's something the client needs to check and confirm as fixed, we submit the ticket as pending until they reply, and mark it solved if they say everything's ok.

If a client replies to a solved ticket, it will be reopened. Sometimes clients reply just to say thanks. If so, we set it back to solved without comment.

It is important that solved tickets contain some record of what we did. This is usually not difficult, as your communication with the client will describe what actions you've taken. But that's not always the case.

Some tickets are not raised by clients, but are raised by another agent or by an automated process. In this situation, it's still important that tickets record what actions we took, so we don't close them without a good update. We always leave a couple of sentences to say what we did, even if it was minor.

Before solving a ticket, we use the *How much work was this?* field to give an approximatation of the time we spent on the issue, or we select *chargeable* if it's a ticket we'll invoice for.


#### Deciding what to work on

You are free to work on whichever of your assigned tickets you think is most important. But there are some important things to bear in mind.


#### Triage

We all have limited time. We try to spend it wisely. All other things being equal, it is better to spend spend half an hour solving each of four tickets than to spend two hours on one issue. 


#### Procrastinating

We don't procrastinate about dealing with difficult tickets. Most of our SLA breaches happen when a a complex ticket arrives and is assigned to a busy person. In this situation, it's only natural that we prefer to do other work first. But it is vital that we don't let the hard tickets gather dust while we crack through the easy ones, so we try to be mindful of this bias.

#### Priority

The priority of tickets is important, and we must be biased towards dealing with more urgent tickets before less urgent ones.

Zendesk can help us to balance these factors. When you log in and land on the dashboard, you will see a list of your tickets, ordered by age and priority.

Unless there's a good reason not to, we deal with tickets in the order they are displayed. There's a "play" button at the top right hand corner of the ticket list that will serve up each ticket in turn, moving to the next as you mark things open, pending or solved. 

Zendesk knows each ticket's age, the time it's been since it was updated, its priority and the time left until we breach our SLA. Generally speaking, it makes good decisions about priority.


### Initiatial investigation

When we pick up new tickets or are assigned one where no investigation has yet happened, we complete an initial investigation. If you don't have the right skills for the issue or are not familiar enough with the project to know what to do, reassign the ticket to a more appropriate agent, or consult a delivery manager.

It's important that we don't make changes unless we thoroughly understand what we're being asked to do. To that end, there are a few things we do when a new ticket arrives.


#### Complete all fields

All the fields on a ticket are important. Early in the process, we fill them in - including the type.

The priority and project fields are especially important. We always review them to make sure that they are correct. dxw's [Service Level Agreement](https://dxw.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205117695) explains what the different priorities mean.


#### Understanding the request

We make sure that we understand the request that the client is making. When tickets arrive, they do not always describe the issue clearly. There is some [guidance](https://dxw.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200814655-Tips-for-submitting-tickets) you can send to clients if their tickets are often difficult to understand.

If you're not sure what the client is asking, ask questions. You can call them if you think that it would be easier just to have a conversation about the problem.

When you've reached an understanding of the situation the client is in and what they'd like you to do about it, write it on the ticket in an internal note, so that any other agent looking at the ticket has an easier time.

If the client's request is clear, there's no need to do this bit.


#### Replicating the bug

If the issue is a bug, we replicate the behaviour the client has reported before working on a fix. It's important that we can reliably and repeatably create the conditions necessary for the bug to arise before we start working on it. If we don't do this, we can't tell whether we've fixed the problem.

Sometimes, we find that the steps we need to follow are not exactly the same as those given by the client. If so, add an internal note with your findings.


### Managing tickets

There are a few background tasks that we do to ensure that helpdesk work goes smoothly.

#### Suspended tickets

The work in this section is the responsibility of **Front-line support agents**.

##### Unauthorised contacts

Only people who have been registered in Zendesk are permitted to submit tickets. 

Tickets received from unregistered users are put into the Suspended Tickets view with a reason of "permission denied". We receive a digest email on the systems email to let us know what is in the suspended queue. 

If we see a suspended ticket that looks legitimate, we create a ticket for the project owner and ask if the user should be added. If they can be added, we create them in Clients and Projects as a contact on the appropriate project, and then recover the ticket from the suspended list. If the new user should't be added, we delete the ticket and ask the project owner to resubmit it if required.

If we receive a suspended ticket from someone who is not a contact but is adding useful information, add the information to the relevant ticket as an internal note and then delete the suspended ticket. We make sure the internal note mentions who the information came from.

Unauthorised users submitting tickets will not receive any response, so it is important to check the suspended list frequently.

##### Spam and autoresponders

It's hard to monitor the contents of the suspended tickets view if it's cluttered. So we clean up the list regularly. We delete anything that doesn't need to be recovered or noted.

#### SLA breaches

The work described in this section is the responsibility of **delivery managers**.

We monitor Zendesk for tickets that are or will shortly be breaching our SLA. There are two views to facilitate this: *SLA breaches* and *Approaching SLA breaches*. The number of tickets in these views is also displayed on the monitoring dashboard in the office.

Tickets will appear in these views if they have missed or are about to miss our targets for responsiveness. Our internal SLA targets are more stringent than our contractual SLA, so other than in extreme circumstances, we treat SLA breaches as a prompt for action rather than a crisis.

If a ticket is breaching the SLA or will soon do so, we take some action to avoid the breach. If the assignee is available, they may wish to prioritise work on that ticket. If not, it may be sensible to assign the ticket to someone else who can deal with the problem.

Always remember that all tickets except monitoring issues are subject to the SLA: whether raised by someone within dxw or by a client.

If you think we have breached the SLA badly, or have breached our contractual SLA, we contact the client to apologise and let them know what we're going to do about it.

#### Sampling

The work described in this section is the responsibility of **Harry**.

It's important for us to be able to provide good feedback to the team and catch potential problems before they become serious, so we review a sample of solved tickets at regular intervals. 

If any problems are found with tickets, we give feedback, discuss as a team and change our process if necessary.

#### Following up on bad client feedback

The work described in this section is the responsibility of *delivery managers*.

After each ticket is solved, the requester is emailed to ask for their feedback on our performance. Our feedback is generally very good.

However, we do occasionally get feedback that we have not dealt with a ticket well. In these situations, we always follow up with the ticket requester personally to understand what went wrong. If applicable, we offer to do more work to set the situation straight.

We then also think about what feedback could be given to whoever worked on the ticket, whether it would be sensible to discuss the problem as a team and change our process if necessary.


### Scope

Clients can use the support service to ask for help with any aspect of the service we provide, including help with using the admin and advice on getting the best out of their site.

But there are some limitations. Under the support service, we do not:

* Add any new functionality requiring anything beyond extremely trivial development. This does not generally include installing plugins: checking and installing plugins is allowed
* Alter the source code of a plugin or library maintained by a third party
* Do things that the client can do for themselves in the WordPress administration area. In this situation, help them by letting them know the steps to take to achieve whatever they're trying to do.
* Other than by prior arrangement, communicate on the client's behalf with the operators of third-party services that the site uses
* Install a plugin that fails an inspection
* Do research to identify plugins to solve a particular problem. It's fine to recommend something that we already know of, but in this situation, we usually ask the client to do some searches on the WordPress Directory and suggest one, which we can then check and install.
* Fix complex problems that come up after a plugin or WordPress core update is applied. Exactly what constitutes a complex problem is at our discretion. But if we've spent a couple of hours on an updated-related bug and it's still not fixed, we're probably dealing with one.
* From time to time, we may make an exception to these restrictions. If you think that might be appropriate, ask Harry or a delivery manager. In all of the above cases, we can offer to quote for the required work.

Finally, there is an overarching principle that we don't do anything on a ticket that is very time consuming or that is objectively a bad idea. If you think you're in this situation, ask a delivery manager for advice.


#### Charging for ticket work

If we decide that the ticket is not resolvable under our support service and that the work is chargeable, we reassign the ticket to a delivery manager with an explanation.

It is good to try and think of alternative approaches that we could do under our support service before taking this step - seek advice if you're unsure.
