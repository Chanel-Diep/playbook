## Introduction
### Purpose

For most of dxw's life, we've been small enough that it's been easy for everyone to know what's going on and how to get things done, just by listening to what's going on in the office. That's not the case anymore. We're now at the point where we need a reference for the way we do things. A place to capture the changes we agree to make. Something canonical that tells us what the current "right way" to do things is.

We'll always iterate on this document. It will never be complete or entirely correct, and we should always explore better ways to get things done. But now, when we've found one, it'll be recorded here. And once it is, it'll be the way we do things until we find something better.

This document lives in Github. Anyone on the team can edit it, and should do so. But an edit should never be a substitute for discussion and agreement, so be careful about making significant changes. This document is also public, because there should be very little about our process that cannot be open. But there might be something from time to time, so don't forget that changes here get published to the world.

Finally, this document is inspired by [Thoughtbot's excellent playbook](https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/), some of which we have made our own. Thanks, Thoughtbot!

### Why are we all here?

The web has revolutionised the way society works. Most of society has reaped the benefits of digital technology, but most public services lag behind. As a result, they are often expensive, and not very good. 

Since dxw was founded in 2008, a lot of things have become better. The Government Digital Service has changed the conversation about how and why services get built, and many are much better as a result. But the challenge facing the public sector is not one that any organisation could tackle alone. 

In addition to talented in-house teams who understand how to deliver great services, the public sector needs talented suppliers who understand how to work with it. And who are driven by a desire to make public services better. And who understand how to combine a modern technogical approach with agile principles of development and user-centricity. That's what dxw is here to do.

We build digital public services that are flexible, efficient, effective and useful. We want people's experience of those services to be straightforward, positive and seamless. We believe that in building those services using agile principles, we can help government to embed those same principles in other parts of their organisations. We hope to help government become associated with technological excellence.

We can help the public sector to spend less on technology so that it can spend more on education, healthcare, policing and welfare. We believe that it is possible to use technology and agile principles to help government become something recognisably, radically better: and we want to help make it happen.

### Values

We think that it's very important to have a talented team if we're going to succeed. But just as important as raw talent is our ability to work well together. These are the values that we aspire to, and help each other to achieve.

#### Helpful
We are helpful, useful and expert. We give practical and pragmatic advice to each other, and to our clients.

#### Honest
We are honest, trustworthy and straightforward. We give plain-spoken, frank, accurate feedback and advice, and we never mislead or obfuscate.

#### Positive
We are positive, cheerful and supportive. Even in crisis, we stay optimistic. We [assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith) and offer constructive challenge.

#### Creative
We are creative, diverse and curious. We help each other to learn and improve and we're sensitive to each others' needs. We love technology and finding new ways to solve problems.

#### Determined
We are determined, discerning and motivated. We believe in high standards, we enjoy doing things properly, and we're loath to settle for less.

#### Reliable
We are reliable, consistent and committed. We make every effort to live up to each others' expectations, and to exceed the expectations of our clients.
