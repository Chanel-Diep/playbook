# Playbook

## Purpose

For most of dxw's life, we've been small enough that it's been easy for everyone to know what's going on and how to get things done, just by listening to what's going on in the office. That's not the case anymore. We're now at the point where we need a reference for the way we do things. A place to capture the changes we agree to make. Something canonical that tells us what the current "right way" to do things is.

We'll always iterate on this document. It will never be complete or entirely correct, and we should always explore better ways to get things done. But now, when we've found one, it'll be recorded here. And once it is, it'll be the way we do things until we find something better.

This document lives in Github. Anyone on the team can edit it, and should do so. But an edit should never be a substitute for discussion and agreement, so be careful about making significant changes. This document is also public, because there should be very little about our process that cannot be open. But there might be something from time to time, so don't forget that changes here get published to the world.

Finally, this document is inspired by [Thoughtbot's excellent playbook](https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/), some of which we have made our own. Thanks, Thoughtbot!
