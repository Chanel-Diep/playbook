### Supporting services

The technology team supports some of our client services. We split our support
into two units: GovPress and non-GovPress.

#### Support helpdesk

For both units we use [Zendesk](https://dxw.zendesk.com) to manage support
requests. All incidents and requests for us to fix a problem or make a change to
a site we support come to us via Zendesk as a ticket. We use tickets to manage
requests in order to:

- keep track of all the things we need to do and what state they're in, for us
  and our clients
- have a record of the changes we're asked to make
- ensure that we only accept change requests from people who are authorised

If a client asks us to do something via any other channel, we ask them to email
the request to support@dxw.com, which opens a ticket in Zendesk, or open a
ticket directly.

It's important that we do not do any work on a client website or service unless
we are working during scheduled development time or on a relevant ticket.

##### Support rota

We work on tickets by having a developer from the delivery team and another
developer from the GovPress team on support according to a rota, supported by an
operations engineer.

Delivery team developers are assigned to support for one week at a time and work
on tickets for the whole week. They are responsible for the non-GovPress support
requests.

#### Support principles

##### Be responsive

Clients expect us to deal with their issues promptly. But they understand that
this isn't always possible. They are generally forgiving of the fact that we're
sometimes busy, and they understand that some issues are complex and require
long investigations.

The thing most clients value above all else is being kept informed of what is
going on. The first quality of a good ticket experience is responsiveness. We
keep clients informed of what we're doing, even if there hasn't been much
progress.

##### Stick to your commitments

It's important that we do what we say we'll do, and don't promise things we
can't deliver. If we're unable to deal with a ticket in good time and leave an
update saying we'll work on it tomorrow, we must meet that commitment.

It is doubly bad to fail to meet a commitment and not say anything about it.
Responsiveness is always the priority. So if for some reason we couldn't do what
we said we'd do, we always respond to say so.

##### Make a good impression

In tickets as in all things, we are mindful of dxw's [values](#our-values).

Many clients' only routine contact with us is via support tickets, so it's vital
that their experience of the support system is a good one, and that they have a
positive experience with us personally.

In general:

- we are personable, friendly, and helpful
- if things look like they're going to get difficult or the client seems
  unhappy, we are honest and assume good faith
- if we make a mistake, we take responsibility and apologise, and if the client
  seems very upset, we let the account manager know
- if we do become annoyed or frustrated by a ticket, we come back to it later

##### Don't over-deliver

Of course, every client would like us to go the extra mile to solve their
problem. But they also understand that to do that for them would mean bad
service for another client - or that we never get to their issue, because we're
too busy gold-plating the solution to someone else's.

While we do everything we can to make sure the client is happy with our
solution, we are also mindful of what's practical. We don't do extensive
development work on tickets, or trial new approaches. We don't play with new
tools or sink hours into interesting bugs. We set those things aside, and
schedule time to do them later.

The main purpose of a ticket is to take some action that solves the problem, as
quickly as possible. Generally speaking, we do the most time-efficient thing
that we can. Of several potential, acceptable solutions that solve the problem,
we do the one which can be implemented the most quickly.

#### Deciding what to work on

People on support are free to work on whichever tickets they are assigned to and
think is most important. But there are some important things to bear in mind.

##### Triage

We all have limited time. We try to spend it wisely. All other things being
equal, it is better to spend half an hour solving each of four tickets than to
spend two hours on one issue.

##### Priority

The priority of tickets is important, and we must be biased towards dealing with
more urgent tickets before less urgent ones.

Each ticket's priority should be reviewed regularly: whenever we update a
ticket, we check the priority to make sure it's still right.

##### Time since last response

Our clients expect to be kept in the loop. If a ticket hasn't had any activity
for a while, it might be a sign that it needs following up on. This might mean
taking over where another person on support left off.

#### Initial investigation

It's important that we don't make changes unless we thoroughly understand what
we're being asked to do, and are confident that the client understands and has
approved of the implications of the change.

##### Replicate the bug

If the issue is a bug, we replicate the behaviour the client has reported before
working on a fix. It's important that we can reliably and repeatably create the
conditions necessary for the bug to arise before we start working on it. If we
don't do this, we can't tell whether we've fixed the problem. If we don't have
enough information to do this, we ask the client to provide it before
continuing.

##### Ensure the client has understood and approved the change

When presented with a problem, clients don't always ask us to do the most
appropriate thing to fix it. Sometimes we can think of a better solution.
Sometimes the change the client asks for has some implication that they haven't
considered.

Our helpdesk service is advisory, so we're not afraid to suggest alternative
approaches and ideas if we have them - including where there's a better
solution, but [at a cost](#charging-for-ticket-work). We always give options
when we can.

#### Scope

Clients can use the support service to ask for help with any aspect of the
service we provide, including help with using the admin panel and advice on
getting the best out of their site. But there are some limitations. Under the
support service, we do not:

- add any new functionality requiring anything beyond extremely trivial
  development or plugin integration
- alter the source code of a plugin or library maintained by a third party
- do things that the client can do for themselves, letting them know how to do
  it themselves instead
- other than by prior arrangement, communicate on the client's behalf with the
  operators of third-party services that the site uses

From time to time, we may make an exception to these restrictions. If you think
that might be appropriate, ask the account manager for the client.

#### Charging for ticket work

If you decide that a ticket asks for work to be done which falls outside the
scope for support, then the work is chargeable. In this situation, we reassign
the ticket to the account manager with an explanation of why the work is
chargeable and a rough idea of how much work the client is asking for.

It is good to try to think of alternative approaches that we could do under our
support service before taking this step - seek advice if you're unsure.

The person you assign the ticket to will then treat it as a [lead](#sales), and
contact the client to make a plan.
