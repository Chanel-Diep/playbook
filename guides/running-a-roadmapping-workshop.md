# Running a roadmapping workshop

For an alpha or beta, or for a significant update to a live service, we run a roadmapping workshop.

These are based on the [Seven questions to build a roadmap](http://www.jamiearnold.com/blog/2014/07/22/seven-questions-to-build-a-roadmap) described by Jamie Arnold.

## Questions for roadmapping

1. **What are we trying to learn or prove?**

   What questions are we trying to answer? What do we need to know to make good decisions? What assumptions should we be testing? What might we already know?

1. **Who are the users?**

   Are they members of the public, professionals or staff? What different groups, circumstances and behaviours might be important? Are they current or potential users?

1. **What are we operating?**

1. **What are we saying?**

1. **What are our assumptions?**

1. **What are our dependencies?**

1. **What capabilities do we need?**
