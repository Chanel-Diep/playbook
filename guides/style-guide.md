## A-Z

**Digital Marketplace**: the government procurement website should be capitalised as it is a proper noun to
distinguish it from other digital marketplaces (like eBay).

**dxw**: in client-facing/public-facing documents, dxw should be lowercase.

**G-Cloud**: formatted thusly with hyphen and capital letters. Never 'G-cloud' or 'g-cloud' or 'G Cloud' or 'GCloud'.

**GovPress**: not 'Govpress', 'Gov Press' etc.

**multisite**: if referring to the feature directly, "Multisite" should be capitalised. If referring to an
multisite WordPress setup, "multisite". Never "multi site" or "multi-site".

**open source**: always lower case.

**plugin**: not 'plug in' or 'plug-in'.

**Rails**: for the Ruby framework, always upcase. Lower case is fine for the things trains run on.

**WordPress**: not 'Word Press', 'Wordpress' or 'WP'.
