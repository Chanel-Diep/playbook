# Card sorting

**Things you'll need:** Index cards, post-it notes, pens, a large table, 3-5 participants, an observer/note taker, a smartphone for pictures. 

**Estimated time:** 60 minutes

## Best to use when
Card sorts are a good way to figure out what to call things and how they should be organised so that users can find what they are looking for. It can also be used to prioritise what to work on in a given sprint and can help teams identify missing user needs. 

**There are two types of card sorts:**

Open - participants group sample content, ideas, needs and come up with a name for the category. 

Closed - participants move content, ideas, and needs to already named categories. This is also useful for later stages of  designing something, when content is revised and a well-tested structure is already in place. You can also use closed card sorting to prioritise needs, features and products.

You can also think of these as two parts of the design process:
Use open sorts to understand what goes together and what it should be called. 
Use closed sorts to test and validate what you already have with more people and other types of users. 

Hybrid sessions are also useful. You provide categories but let people create new ones, and remove and rename categories if they feel it doesn’t fit into any of the existing ones.

## Instructions (open sort)

1. Prepare category cards for each participant. *Write categories on cards for a closed sort.
2. Prepare some content cards for each category (a set for each participant)
3. Ask participants to group the cards in the way that makes sense to them and give the groups names. *For a closed sort participants move content cards into categories you’ve prepared.
4. Discuss why they grouped the cards the way they did
5. If there too many categories and time allows, you can try to get participants to reach a consensus
6. Repeat

## Things to remember

**Quantitative vs. qualitative sorts**
An automated quantitative sort online can be a good start to identify categories. They can also be used to test your sort on a larger scale after the in-person sessions.
**People get tired**
Avoid the temptation to sort everything in one go. Limit the number to 30-40 cards
**Consider the loudest voices** 
When discussing the reasons for groupings and moving things around to reach a consensus, be mindful of the loudest people in the room and how this affects results
**Randomise**
When giving participants a stack of content cards, make sure to randomise the order they’re in 
**Take lots of pictures**
Clearly mark these with the participant, date and number
