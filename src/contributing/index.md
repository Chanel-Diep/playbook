The Playbook is public and anyone, inside or outside of dxw, can suggest changes
to it. This means you!

We manage changes via GitHub 'Pull Requests'. This is a technical term for
requesting a specific change is made to a repository of text. Often this text is
code, but in this case it's the contents of this playbook. It allows everyone to
see exactly what changes are being proposed, and for discussion and changes to
be made before it is 'merged', and those changes to be recorded for the future.

If you're experienced in doing this, then all you need to know is that this
repository is available at <https://github.com/dxw/playbook>

If creating a pull request is new to you, then don't worry, here is a guide to
use Netlify CMS to create one for you.

## What you will need

You will need a GitHub account. If you don't already have one, then
[sign up here](https://github.com/signup). You do not need to be added to the
dxw GitHub organisation to be able to suggest changes.

## Suggesting a change

1. Click on the yellow 'Edit this site' link
2. If you are not logged in, you need to log in with your GitHub account
3. If you are asked if you want to 'fork the repo', you do.
4. Choose the page you want to change.

   - If it's an existing page, find it under 'Collections'.
   - If it's a new page you want to add, find the appropriate section under
     'Collections' and click the 'New <page type>' button.

5. Make your edits in the 'Rich Text' editor.
6. Click 'Save' at the top of the page
7. Click 'Status: Draft' and choose 'In review'

Your suggested changes will not be live yet. Your suggestions should be
available to view on the
[GitHub Pull Requests page](https://github.com/dxw/playbook/pulls). After a few
minutes, you should be able to view a preview of the Playbook with your changes
by clicking on the URL next to 'ðŸ˜ŽÂ Browse the preview'

## Reviewing changes

Everyone's suggested changes that are being reviewed are publicly available.
Anyone can publicly comment on a suggested change. Only GitHub accounts that
have been added to the dxw GitHub organisation and staff team can 'merge' a pull
request and make it live. If you are not on this list and want to be, please
email [support@dxw.com](mailto:support@dxw.com) with your GitHub username.

To see the suggested changes, you can click the 'Files changed' tab to see lines
of text that have been removed (in red) and lines of text that have been added
(in green). Alternatively you can click on the URL next to 'ðŸ˜ŽÂ Browse the
preview' to see what the Playbook will look like if this change is accepted.

Anyone can comment on a pull request, and the more voices the better. It's
suggested that you contact one or two people specifically who you think would be
good to review your changes, or alternatively ask in the #dxw-playbook slack
channel
