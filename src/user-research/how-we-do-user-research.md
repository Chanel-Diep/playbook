We have a set of guides that explain how we do user research at dxw.

The guidance applies to all user researchers employed by dxw, both staff and
dxw friends.

The guidance builds on our user research
[principles](/user-research/#user-research-principles). It also builds on the
[guidance for user research in the GDS Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research)
so we can help teams meet the Government
[Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard).

Some of the guidance explains how to do user research in an effective, ethical
and legal way. If your situation isn't covered, and you're not sure what to do,
ask Steph Troeth (Head of User Research), John Waterworth (Principal Researcher), or Coca Rivas (Director of Design).

## User research workflow

These are the things that user researchers usually do on projects.

1. **Support sales and scheduling**

   Researchers contribute to client proposals and scheduling projects. We advise
   on research activities to include in proposals, join in pitch presentations
   and help with scheduling decisions.

   This helps dxw to win good work that delivers valuable results for our
   clients, for users and for ourselves.
2. **Help setup the project and team**

   Researchers get involved with project inception and planning. We review
   existing evidence. And we create research plans that show what we’ll do, why
   and how we’ll do it. We make sure the plan is achievable and allows us to do
   research at a sustainable pace.

   This helps teams to focus on understanding and meeting the needs of users,
   and to produce the best results with the people, time and resources we have.

3. **Recruit people for research**

   Researchers recruit appropriate participants for research activities. Finding
   the right participants at the right time is always challenging, so we start
   recruiting as soon as we can and use a variety of approaches to reach
   everyone we need. We keep track of who participates in our research, so we
   can be confident that we’re including the right people.

   This helps teams to learn about all their users and produce services that
   work well for everyone.

4. **Plan and do research activities**

   This is the most obvious and visible part of our work. We choose research
   activities that provide strong evidence and reliable answers, for the least
   time, effort and cost. And we choose activities that help our teams and
   different kinds of users to participate.

   We record what we do and how we do it, for each other, and for those who come
   after us.

   This helps teams to embed regular research into their agile practices and get
   the best results from the effort they put in.

5. **Analyse research and produce findings**

   Researchers carefully analyse the different kinds of data we collect. We
   analyse data in batches and record our findings from sprint to sprint. And we
   involve our colleagues and clients in analysis to make sure our findings are
   clear and relevant.

   This helps teams understand, believe in and act quickly on what they learn.
6. **Help teams make good decisions**

   Researchers produce findings and other recommendations that help teams make
   good decisions about what to do next and how to approach it. We get actively
   involved in identifying opportunities, creating design ideas and setting
   priorities.

   This helps teams to create great services that work well for users, and to
   strike a balance between short-term wins and more complex, long term changes.
7. **Create and share outputs**

   Researchers create and share formal outputs like plans, presentations,
   reports and diagrams. These record and communicate the important things we
   learn. We create finished outputs from sprint to sprint, not just at the end
   of a project. And we think carefully about how we present and share these
   outputs to produce the most impact.

   This helps our clients and other stakeholders use and benefit from what we
   learned both during the project and long after we’ve gone.

8. **Take care of research data**

   Researchers know it’s important to manage research data carefully. We follow
   our [privacy policy](https://www.dxw.com/privacy-statement/) and
   [ISO27001 certification](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001) when
   collecting, processing and storing research data to make sure we comply with
   that
   [General Data Protection Regulation](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/).

   This helps teams to get the most from the research data they collect, while
   protecting the privacy of the people taking part.
