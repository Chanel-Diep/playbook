## Managing your day to day work

### Working hours

Our working hours are 10:00-18:00, Monday to Friday. Some people work different
hours by arrangement. Anyone is free to do that as long as their hours of work
don't make it hard for other people to get things done. For example, many people
arrive earlier than 10:00 and leave earlier, which is generally fine.

Each team has a short standup every morning, where we each tell the whole team
about a single thing we will get done that day. If you think you're going to be
late, you should let everyone know in the project Slack channel.

Most developers have maintenance responsibilities, which they do during their
[support rotation](#support-rota).

We do our very best to
[work at a sustainable pace](#work-at-a-sustainable-pace). But sometimes, when
we're approaching a firm deadline or a launch, or a client is having an
emergency, we work longer hours than normal. From time to time, there's an
emergency that means we have to work during unsociable hours to solve the
problem. Neither of these happen very often, but they are a normal part of life
at dxw.

Sending emails or posting in Slack outside of working hours can be a good way to
get things off your mind, but it can create an unintended sense of urgency for
the people who receive your message. Try to avoid creating that urgency when
it’s not necessary. For example, by specifically saying that you don’t expect an
immediate response.

Unless they are actually urgent, you can ignore messages you receive outside of
working hours and handle them when you are back at work.

### Working days

#### Client days

We charge clients “time and materials” for the work we do, based on a
[per person day rate](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-10/documents/92768/432689933684667-sfia-rate-card-2018-05-23-1413.pdf).

We generally schedule team members to work on particular projects for a whole
two week sprint at a time, and track and bill that time in half days and whole
days. Delivery leads work with the finance team to track and invoice the time of
the team; having regularly patterned working helps the process to run as
smoothly as possible, without confusion and without taking more time than
needed. Any working arrangement needs to make it straightforward to track,
report and invoice for your time.

When working on a project we work as a single multi-disciplinary team. We’re
often working on phases of projects where there’s a lot of unknowns and a lot of
learning, so we use agile approaches and strongly favour being able to work
together on problems. That’s often easier when co-located, particularly when
working with clients, pairing, or participating in workshops. Any working
arrangement needs to support active synchronous collaboration with the team.

#### Internal teams

Internal facing roles, in which time is not billable to a client, have a more
regularly structured full- or part-time working week.

We encourage people in internal facing roles to take part in dxw time activities
to contribute to our culture and to improve our ways of working.

#### dxw time

We regularly come together to work on our own projects and processes, most often
on a Friday.

This dxw time is important for us to maintain our strong culture and identity,
and to improve our practices, separate from the clients we work for.

### Working from home

We are able to work successfully in a remote capacity, from our homes. On
occasions, it may be necessary to work from one of our office spaces, a client
location or another location approved by dxw in order to complete a specific
task. It is important that you remain contactable and productive.

### Working from Overseas Policy

dxw is a UK-based business, with staff working from locations around the UK.

We don't support overseas employment unless exceptional circumstances apply.
This is because there are usually significant overheads involved in complying
with local employment laws, registering for and paying the relevant taxes.

If you believe there are exceptional circumstances, a request can be made for
consideration via your line manager. All decisions must be made by a Director.

We will take the following factors into account for any cases we consider.

The legal framework for a decision:

- the individual’s right to work in a particular location
- the employer’s obligation to comply with the relevant country’s employment
  laws, and how complex and costly that is to achieve
- the employer’s obligation to comply with the relevant country’s taxation
  rules, and how complex and costly that is to achieve

Operational challenges we need to be comfortable with:

- management of time zones
- management of a fully remote team member
- client and contractual procurement needs
- the requirements of the role

We would expect individuals to meet any costs (travel, internet, equipment etc)
associated with their working overseas.

dxw will always retain the right to ask you to return to the UK for work with
suitable notice, in line with our employment contract.

### Reporting your time

Everyone who works on a client project at dxw is responsible for reporting the
time they spend on projects. We usually work with our clients on a
[time and materials basis](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-pay-for-digital-outcomes-and-specialists-services#time-and-materials),
so it’s important we can accurately track and report how our time is spent on
client projects.

We use [Productive](https://app.productive.com/) to schedule our work, which
helps us to forecast our capacity over future weeks and months in a reliable
way.

We track our time at the same level of granularity that we bill it – for almost
everyone in the team, that’s half days or whole days.

#### What to do when reporting your time

When reporting our time, we follow these guidelines:

- If what was scheduled matches reality, simply confirm this time.
- If you worked on a named project (client or internal including "dxw Support"),
  that differs from the schedule, record your time as that.
- If you worked on something else, leave the time blank or zero out what you
  were scheduled to work on.
- If you were off sick or on leave, make sure this is recorded on BreatheHR and
  it should be automatically copied across to Productive.
- If you were away due to a regular day off, as part of your working pattern,
  leave the time blank or zero out what you were scheduled to work on.

If you’re not doing client work, then unless you’re working on one of a handful
of named internal projects or support, you don’t need to record your time
against any other piece of work – the assumption is you’re doing valuable work,
whether it’s learning, helping with recruitment or improving our tooling and
processes, and we don’t need itemised time tracking to justify that.

We’ve set up the platform, so that it understands individual team members’
working patterns. This means the team don’t need to worry about entering in
their non working days.

Our delivery leads lend a helping hand when delivery team members aren’t sure
how to record their time – they’ve been doing this for a long while and have a
well developed sense for it.

### Getting things you need

Anytime you need to order something or experience a problem with your working
set up you can find guidance in the playbook, through a ‘help’ slack channel or
from your line manager who can point you in the right direction.

#### Helpful Slack channels

- **\#help-purchasing**: see the guide for equipment purchase and use the
  purchasing form. Additional questions can be asked through the channel.
- **\#help-travel**: see the travel and
  [expenses policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HCNkW_wgJ_CDKXGNwdcsx64-F2AZtbfML7_Tb_PvDRA/edit#)
  first and then use the channel for additional questions.
- **\#help-internal-tech-support**: for any technical support questions.
- **\#help-tools-and-subscriptions:** for any questions about the purchase and
  use of external tools and subscriptions.
- **\#help-productive**: for any questions about the use of
  [Productive](https://app.productive.io).
- **\#help-learning-and-development-ideas:** find and share learning and
  development ideas.
- **\#help-learning-and-development-bookings**: see the guide for how to get
  approval and book your L&D.
- **\#help-hr-non-confidential**: for any non confidential questions about what
  we provide.

#### E﻿quipment guidance

W﻿e can support you with your home-office set-up, including things like a desk,
monitor and keyboard. Here's a
[guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Q8zOEm4cd0ZDGqkT8Bcg8G1CCK_vLlwMtOFVgJalAU/edit#heading=h.1z3dei2pr1jh)
which shows what we can support with.

### Claiming expenses

From time to time, some of us spend our own money at work. Most often, this is
things like:

- Train fares for unexpected travel
- Refreshments purchased for meetings with clients
- Stationery/materials, especially for workshops or events

dxw will always pay expenses which are:

- **Necessary**: We only expense things we need in order to be able to complete
  our work.
- **Proportionate**: The total expense should be proportionate to the work at
  hand. In general, we try to avoid spending lots of money. For example, unless
  you have a good reason, don't get a cab to a meeting when you could get a
  train.

Wherever possible, it's best to check that expenses can be reclaimed before
incurring them.

We manage expenses using Xero. For more information about how to do this, see
the [guide on claiming expenses](/guides/claiming-expenses)

### Travel and Accommodation Policy

Currently, the default for everyone in the organisation is working from home.

For this period, we will consider regular travel to an office space without a
business critical need as commuting.

Commuting costs are the responsibility of individuals, while dxw will fund
business critical travel and accommodation.

A business critical need is defined as:

- Client meetings
- Meetings with your line manager (e.g. during probation, monthly check-ins,
  quarterly reviews, post parental / sick leave)
- Team meetups (e.g. design community, tech forum, away days, Board meetings)
- All-staff in-person events
- Conferences and training events

At present, there is no obligation to attend in-person meetings.

As with all company expenses, please keep in mind that costs should be necessary
and proportionate. We rely on everyone to be conscious of the impact of their
travel on the environment. If you are able to take public transport, over being
driven/driving yourself, please do.

Accommodation will be covered for business-critical events that require
overnight stays.

[There are guidelines including rates and a list of recommended hotels.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HCNkW_wgJ_CDKXGNwdcsx64-F2AZtbfML7_Tb_PvDRA/edit)

Accommodation should be booked by the individual on a Pleo company debit card or
expensed.

Any decision that this policy does not clearly resolve, should be made by the
appropriate director.

### Calendars and documents

We use Google Workspace to manage calendars, write and share documents. There is
a dxw folder where we share most of the things we write. If you can't see it
when you log in to Google Drive, you'll need to ask someone else to send you the
link, and then click "Add to drive".

When we write new things, we try to save them in a sensible folder within the
existing structure.

### Internal tech support

If you experience problems with laptops, wi-fi, tools, etc, post a message in
the **\#help-internal-tech-support** Slack channel.

### Using a personal device at work

Most of us use at least one personal device as part of our work, because it's
more convenient than carrying lots of devices around. However, no one is
obligated to use a personal device for work. If you need a dxw-provided phone,
tablet or other device, please ask for one.

Anyone who does use a personal device must take reasonable care to ensure that
it cannot compromise dxw's security. This includes implementing prudent security
measures, being mindful that your personal devices could be targeted as part of
an attack on dxw or its clients. For example, you might receive an email to your
personal email address designed to trick you into revealing a work-related
password.

Exactly what security measures are prudent may vary depending on the device and
what you're using it for. Some good practice examples are:

- Configuring screens to lock after a period of inactivity
- Ensuring that work-related data on the device is regularly backed up
- Encrypting storage
- Using good passwords and changing defaults
- Avoiding connecting devices to untrustworthy networks (internet cafes,
  security conferences, unencrypted (open) wifi networks, etc)
- Disposing of your device securely when you no longer need it

If you need to use a personal device but cannot take these sorts of measures,
you should get permission first.

### Report a lost or stolen device used for work

Submit an urgent ticket by sending an email to support-emergency@dxw.com stating
which work device was lost or stolen and when the incident had occurred.

Our support staff will be immediately notified, at any time of day.

### Data protection

Though dxw doesn't control much personal data, our clients generally do. And
some of it may be held on sites that we host. Everyone at dxw has a
responsibility to keep that data safe, and process it in accordance with the
[data protection principles](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act).

In particular, we:

- Only process personal data as part of work on the service that we're
  contracted to provide to a client
- Don't access personal data unless we need to in order to do our jobs: don't
  read people's personal data or private communications without good reason
- We do not ever disclose people's personal data to anyone outside dxw unless
  specifically instructed, and are satisfied that it is legal to do so

If you have any questions about data protection, talk to the Data Protection
Officer, Gurps.

### Protective marking scheme

Some information that we have is confidential. We use a protective marking
scheme so that everyone understands how to handle this material, and who they're
allowed to disclose it to. All of the documents and data we hold will fall into
one of the categories below.

- **Management-in-Confidence**: internal documents whose circulation within dxw
  needs to be restricted.
- **Company Confidential**: information owned by dxw which would be of value to
  those outside the company, such as competitors, and whose loss or theft would
  potentially damage the company.
- **Client Confidential** or **Commercial in Confidence**: information owned by
  dxw or its clients, which needs to remain confidential between dxw and the
  client.
- **Unclassified**: information, which would not be of significant commercial
  value to those outside dxw.

Some of our clients also have protective marking schemes. For example, all
central government bodies will apply the
[Government Protective Marking System (GPMS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications).
If you are in possession of materials that are protectively marked using other
schemes, treat them as company confidential.

We take care to handle all data carefully, but when information is protectively
marked, extra requirements apply.

Because we value openness highly, we take care not to over-classify information.
We don't protectively mark information unless there is a good reason to keep it
confidential.

#### Management-in-confidence

This category is used only for dxw's most confidential information. For example,
employment records, salary details and company strategy documents.

Do not share any information with this marking with any person, whether internal
or external to dxw.

This information:

- Must be clearly labelled or described as "Management-in-confidence"
- When printed

  - Stored only in a locked container
  - Transported only via courier, recorded delivery or personally by dxw staff
  - Destroyed by cross-cut shredding when no longer required

- When digital

  - Stored in an encrypted format
  - Communicated only when encrypted or via an encrypted connection, unless
    emailed from one dxw.com address to another

#### Company Confidential

This category is used for information which should not be communicated outside
dxw. For example, details about how we operate security controls or internal
discussions about client work.

Exactly the same controls apply to this information as detailed under
Management-in-confidence, with the exception that Company Confidential
information can be shared within dxw as required.

#### Client Confidential or Commercial in Confidence

This category is used for information which is disclosed to a limited group of
people external to dxw, or which is unclassified information we have received
from clients. For example, dxw proposals, presentations for pitches or planning
documents.

Unless otherwise specified, all unclassified information we receive from clients
falls into this category.

This information:

- Must be clearly labelled or described as "Client Confidential" or "Commercial
  in Confidence"
- When printed:

  - Stored out of sight
  - Destroyed by cross-cut shredding when no longer required

- When digital:

  - Stored in an encrypted format when on exchangeable media or a mobile device

As a rule of thumb, label a document as Client Confidential if it mostly
contains the client's confidential information, or Commercial in Confidence if
it mostly contains dxw's.

#### Unclassified

Anything not captured by the sections above is unclassified. Examples are
external marketing material, general emails and letters.

Beyond a general duty to treat information carefully, unclassified information
is not subject to any specific restrictions.

### Email signature

**Note:** please use Helvetica or Arial as the font in your emails.

Name<br> Job Title<br> name@dxw.com<br> Twitter handle - if you’re comfortable
to share<br> Mobile - if you’re comfortable to share<br>

www.dxw.com :: 0345 2577520 :: @dxw :: creating better digital public services

### Email autoresponder

If you require an out of office message on your email account please follow the
[instructions given by the mail service provider](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/25922)
and include the contact details for another member of the team for any urgent
queries and a return date.

## Your pay, pension and other benefits

All perks and benefits are available to the dxw team after the successful
passing of their probationary period.

### Changes to your details

Please tell us promptly if your name, address, telephone number, next of kin
details or banking details change and keep those details up to date in Breathe.

### Pay Policy

#### Purpose

The purpose of the dxw pay policy is to give us a framework to pay salaries at
the highest level we can, in the fairest way possible and in the most
sustainable way for the long-term commercial health of the business. Alongside
our mission and values, and the way we look after and develop our teams, it’s an
important part of us being able to attract and retain great people.

#### Principles

The following principles underpin the policy:

- Transparency
- Parity amongst similar roles
- Equality of pay for those with the same role
- Clear levels of responsibility and accountability
- Clear career progression

#### How the policy works

1. Applies to all staff in both billable and non billable teams. Statutory
   directors will each have a performance framework that is independent from
   this policy.
2. Billable team pay has published pay points per level, that are based on 3
   main factors:

   - [Skills for the Information Age (SFIA)](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-12/documents/92768/886204607156866-sfia-rate-card-2020-07-17-1338.pdf)
     standards and rates which clients use to measure dxw against
   - profitability margins based on expected billable rates
   - the labour market and salaries based on this

3. Non billable team pay has published pay bands that are based fundamentally on
   the labour market, but could also include other factors such as professional
   qualifications and sales targets.
4. Each director is responsible for overseeing pay for their teams and has
   overall responsibility for justifying decisions against the principles and
   criteria in this policy. This policy will be reviewed at least every 2 years.
   The review will take place between October and February, to avoid changes to
   salaries shortly before the annual CPI rise. Any changes to pay points /
   bands will be subject to approval by the dxw board.
5. For roles equivalent to
   [SFIA levels 1-5](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-12/documents/92768/886204607156866-sfia-rate-card-2020-07-17-1338.pdf)
   we would expect promotions or pay changes to be handled within the team based
   on the progression framework, with a director or delegated head of taking
   responsibility for this
6. For roles that are more senior i.e.
   [SFIA level 6](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-12/documents/92768/886204607156866-sfia-rate-card-2020-07-17-1338.pdf)
   equivalent or above we would expect the board to consider these, with
   internal interview panels to help make a decision (where necessary)
7. Everyone should have an annual review of their performance and career
   progression and pay as a minimum after passing probation. It's up to each
   line manager to arrange more frequent check-ins on progression, so that the
   outcome of the annual review is not a surprise
8. Line managers are responsible for ensuring that all staff are given equal
   opportunities, and pay discussions are fair and inclusive. If staff would
   like an independent opinion in these discussions, they should contact Vanessa
   in the first instance who can facilitate.
9. dxw works with an independent HR advisor, who can assist if needed to help
   resolve any issues.

#### Cost of living

10. London weighting of £4,000 per year applies to staff who earn under £40,000
    per year to help them with the additional costs of living in London.

    - This applies to people who live in a London borough.
    - If someone’s salary increases above this level, London weighting will
      gradually taper off (by £500 for each £1000 of extra salary) between
      £40,000 and £48,000
    - The rationale for these numbers is taken from Trust for London research
      which shows London weighting materially benefits people on salaries under
      £40,000.
    - It is subject to tax & NI and is not pensionable
    - It is a fixed rate, not uplifted by CPI

11. Annual cost of living CPI rises will apply for staff if the company achieves
    turnover above its minimum target for the preceding financial year.

    - If you’ve passed your probation then you’ll receive your raise in October
      payroll
    - CPI rises will not apply to people who for historic reasons are above the
      maximum pay level for their role, to help us gradually align salaries for
      similar roles
    - If someone is under formal disciplinary or performance procedures, their
      CPI rise will be postponed while this is ongoing
    - The CPI figure comes from published Office of National Statistics data

12. We are committed to paying the London living wage or higher for all staff.

### Cost of living raise

dxw will institute a cost of living raise each year on 1st October. The
percentage will be set by the
[CPI Index](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices) as of 1st
October each year.

- Annual cost of living CPI rises will apply for staff if the company achieves
  turnover above its minimum target for the preceding financial year.
- If you have passed your probation, you will receive your raise in the October
  payroll.
- For those team members who joined prior to 1st October of that year, but
  haven't yet passed probation, you will receive your raise in the month you
  successfully complete it and it will be the same percentage as of 1st October
  CPI that year.
- If you joined on or after 1st October (that year), you will not be eligible
  for a cost of living raise until the following October.
- If you are leaving during October you will not receive the cost of living
  raise.

### Pensions

dxw provides a pension which is operated by Aviva. Once you have passed your 3
month check in, you will be auto enrolled into the scheme, receive details by
post of the necessary employer/employee contributions and have the option to set
your percentage or opt out.

dxw will match any contribution up to 5%.

Your contribution will be relief at source, with 0.8 deducted from your monthly
salary and the additional 0.2 added from tax relief.

For more details on Relief at Source, please visit the
[Aviva website](https://www.aviva.co.uk/retirement/news-views/report/making-sense-of-tax-relief-on-pension-payments/).

### Holiday

If you want to take time off:

1. Discuss the dates with your team and delivery lead

   This gives them a chance to manage any impact it might have on the wider team
   and the project.

2. Request the holiday through BreatheHR

   We use BreatheHR to track who's off and when, so we can plan for it. Your
   line manager can then see and approve your request.

3. Add your holiday to your Google calendar

   If someone is trying to find out where you are, or when you're available, the
   first thing they'll check is your calendar.

   When you are on a client project, you may also need to add your holiday to a
   shared or team calendar. Check with your delivery lead.

Your line manager will normally approve requests that are for 10 days or less
and made at least 4 weeks in advance. Anything longer or requested with less
notice will need to be managed to understand its impact on client, team or
personal work.

When your planned leave has been approved, it will be automatically added to
Productive. Each member of our delivery team uses the tool to record the days
they work on client projects on a weekly basis.

There is more information about dxw's holiday arrangements in your contract of
employment.

### TOIL (Time off in lieu)

Where possible we try to keep a sustainable pace of work and avoid working
outside normal hours; occasionally this might not be possible.

#### How is TOIL calculated?

TOIL (time off in lieu) is awarded when you work over and above your contracted
working hours continuously for a period of time or when you attend/travel to an
event outside of your contracted working hours. TOIL should be agreed with your
delivery lead or line manager ahead of doing the extra work.

We encourage you to use your TOIL within the two weeks of extra work or event
attended as it's meant to be for resting and making up for working at a
sustainable pace. We know this may not be feasible in every case so please speak
to your Line Manager or a member of the HR team if you have any questions.

There are two options of how to use your TOIL, you can calculate the amount of
hours you have accrued (ie half a day) and take it off at once or take a couple
of hours a day spread over a period of time. Planning when you’ll take TOIL is
important, particularly if you’re working on a billable project so please speak
to your Delivery Lead before doing any overtime and arrange when you’ll be able
to take the time back.

#### How to request TOIL?

Using BreatheHR similar to the way that you request holiday, there is a TOIL
drop down, please write a note as to why you are requesting the leave and this
will be approved by a member of the HR team. Please note this will not deduct
from your holiday allowance shown on your BreatheHR dashboard.

### Sickness

This policy covers both short and longer term sickness absences. Our aim is to
look after the health and wellbeing of all dxw staff and the needs of the
company.

#### Communication of sickness

If you’re sick, you must let your line manager and a member of the HR team know
by 10:00am or as soon as you reasonably can after that. This can be done via
email, directly on Slack, phone call or text. Line managers will record and
monitor sickness for individuals within their teams.

If you are unwell and know that you are going to be off for a period of time, or
have been signed off by your GP until a certain date, you don’t need to update
your line manager daily. Let them know when you will be checking in again so
they know when to expect to hear from you.

When you return to work, you must check your sickness has been correctly
recorded in BreatheHR, update it if necessary and mark yourself as returned to
work. Your line manager will then review and close the sick leave. If you're
sick for more than 28 calendar days in a row, you'll also need to provide a
doctor's note.

#### Absence meetings

Your line manager should check-in with you on a regular basis about your
wellbeing, and catch up with you after any sickness absence to see how you are.
If you're sick for more than 7 working days over a rolling 12 month period, your
line manager will invite you to an absence meeting to discuss your health. Where
appropriate, we’ll talk about how we can support your return to work and any
temporary or permanent adjustments which might help improve your wellbeing and
support you to need fewer absences. We might also agree an action plan and / or
a review period. Where we think it would be helpful, we’ll seek advice via an
Occupational Health advisor.

If you have a long term health condition and would like to discuss reasonable
adjustments and ways of working that will help, we welcome a conversation at any
point. The sooner we know, the sooner we can support you.

#### Reasonable Adjustments

A reasonable adjustment is “a change to remove or reduce the effect of an
employees’ disability or long term health condition so they can do their job”.
If you would like to discuss ways of working and reasonable adjustments that
will help you, please talk to your line manager or the people manager at any
point. The sooner we know, the sooner we can support you. We will never use the
disclosure of a disability or long term health condition against you.

We’ll organise a meeting (or a series of meetings if needed) between you, your
line manager, and the people manager where we will discuss any difficulties you
are facing and how dxw are able to support you. If there is any additional
support we can reasonably give you, for example changes to your working pattern
or working environment, we will. We need to balance dxw’s financial
sustainability and the unavoidable impact of any adjustments made on your teams
with your needs to make sure we are able to give fair and consistent treatment
to everyone in need of adjustments, but we will make every effort to make
working at dxw as healthy and sustainable for you as we can.

If you need further support, in addition to any support we are able to provide
you as an employer and through occupational health, there may be state provided
benefits that apply to you. These may include
[disability and sickness benefits](https://www.gov.uk/financial-help-disabled/disability-and-sickness-benefits)
or the [Access to Work scheme](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work). If you would
like support finding, understanding, or applying for alternatives outside of dxw
please discuss this with your line manager or our people manager.

#### Pay

Within any rolling 12 month period, a person will receive:

- full pay for the first 12 days of sickness absence
- half pay (but no less than living wage) for the next 8 days of sickness
  absence
- real living wage for the next 10 days of sickness absence
- statutory sick pay pay after 30 days of sickness absence

There'll be circumstances where we'll make exceptions, because it's not possible
to write a policy that is fair in every situation. This structure will form our
starting point for those decisions. All decisions on exceptions will be made by
the Directors’ group. Our aim is to ensure that we’re treating everyone fairly
and consistently, while being aware of our financial requirements.

#### Long term medical treatment

Regular and open communication with your line manager is important so we can
support you in the best possible way through a period of long term medical
treatment (a period of more than 2 weeks).

If you require long term medical treatment that would affect your ability to
work as normal, but you are still able to work, we will support this wherever we
can. We may consider a change of project or role where that’s an option.

If you finish your treatment, your line manager will organise a meeting to aid
your return to work, or to normal working hours, and ensure your ongoing
wellbeing is supported. We may look at a phased return for example.

#### Escalation

If your sickness absence continues for 3 months after an absence meeting, your
line manager will set up a further meeting to discuss your situation. We will
look to make any further reasonable adjustments to help you get back working.
This might include looking for a suitable alternative role that fits your
circumstances better.

Where we’re unable to reach an agreement that means you’re able to maintain a
reasonable level of attendance for work, we may consider your dismissal. We will
only do this after we have exhausted all other options.

#### Medical appointments

We support staff who need regular time off for medical appointments or
counselling. If you need to attend an appointment, you should talk to your line
manager. For meetings of a couple of hours or so (including travel time), your
line manager will usually ask you to try to make the hours up during the week.
If the time off is longer but less frequent, the hours can be made up over a
longer period of time.

If you need to attend a one off appointment or an appointment for a dependent
let your line manager or delivery lead know as far in advance as possible. If
you are going to be away from work for more than half a day then you will need
to track it through BreatheHR.

In both cases, this might mean a conversation with your delivery lead or
equivalent to make sure work is managed in the best way. If it’s not possible to
recover the time taken in a flexible way, for example, due to the amount or
pattern of time needed, your line manager may need to refer to another one of
our policies. That might include considering a part-time working pattern.

### Compassionate leave

If you need to take compassionate leave, let your line manager and a member of
the HR team know, so we can support you in the right way. If you are on a
project, we can then work with your delivery lead to manage the impact on the
team.

Compassionate leave is likely to affect many of us at some time or other, in
many different ways. Typically compassionate leave covers things like
bereavement or the sudden illness of close relatives and friends. But we
understand that loss can manifest itself in other forms which can affect your
wellbeing.

This policy aims to set some guidance for line managers while also allowing
reasonable flexibility to reflect different circumstances.

In the first instance, line managers can allow up to 3 days of paid
compassionate leave. They should consult their Director for approval if they
think further paid leave may be appropriate in the circumstances.

Our automatic parental bereavement entitlement is 2 weeks of paid leave, as set
out by
[ACAS](https://www.acas.org.uk/time-off-for-bereavement/parental-bereavement-leave-pay).

There is the option for additional time off to be taken using annual or unpaid
leave. This should be agreed between the line manager and Director, in
consultation with HR. We can also provide support for people returning to work
in line with our existing policies.

To record compassionate leave in BreatheHR, choose Other as the Type of Leave,
and choose Compassionate as the Reason.

### Jury duty leave

Jury duty leave is generally paid for each day (or part thereof) that you are
required to attend Court -

- if you are required to complete Jury Service dxw will pay your normal salary
  less £64.95 per day. Once you have completed your Jury Service you are able to
  claim £64.95 towards your loss of earnings, and any care or childcare outside
  of your usual arrangements
  [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/687809/certificate-of-loss-eng.pdf)
- dxw will re-consider the payment amount if an individual is on a case that
  exceeds 4 weeks. This amount will be reviewed by Directors and a decision will
  be made with the individual

Let your line manager or HR manager know as soon as you are able that you have
been requested for Jury Service with a copy of your jury summons

### Parental leave

We’re aware that there is a lot to take in here - please come and talk to the HR
People Manager if you have questions about anything (when you’re ready).

While many terms around parental leave are gendered, gender is not a factor in
what leave you are entitled to from dxw. What matters is whether you, or your
partner if you have one, are pregnant, adopting or having a baby through
surrogacy.

We also make a distinction based on whether you are a primary carer (the person
who will be on parental leave for the longer period of time) or a secondary
carer (the person who will be returning to work first) as there will be
differences in both the statutory and dxw entitlement.

This policy will be reviewed in May 2022.

#### Understanding your entitlement

We’ve detailed the different entitlements that dxw offer in addition to your
statutory entitlement below. There’s an
[online calculator](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-paternity-pay-leave) for
working out your statutory entitlement. If you’d like support working out your
anticipated pay and you’re ready to share the news even just with a select few,
you can speak to the HR People Manager for a personal breakdown of your
entitlement.

#### If you’re having IVF or another fertility treatment

If you share with us that you are undergoing fertility treatment you will be
supported in the same way as for other longer term medical treatment. Regular,
open and confidential communication with your line manager will be important, so
we can support you in the best possible way.

#### If you’re pregnant

Summary: In most cases, you will be paid 100% of your normal salary for the
first 18 weeks of leave, reduced to the government statutory rate per week for
the following 21 weeks.

##### What you are legally entitled to:

If you’re pregnant, you’ll be entitled to Statutory Maternity Leave (SML) and
probably entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP). Statutory Maternity Leave
entitles you to 52 weeks leave, made up of Ordinary Maternity Leave for the
first 26 weeks and Additional Maternity Leave for the last 26 weeks.

Statutory Maternity Pay is paid by the government for up to 39 weeks. They will
pay you 90% of your normal salary for the first 6 weeks of your leave. You must
have worked for dxw for 26 weeks before your
[qualifying week](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/20771/qualifying-week.jpg)
(the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth) to be eligible for SMP or
you will be entitled to
[Maternity Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-allowance) instead.

##### What dxw offers in addition:

If you are the primary carer, dxw will pay you 100% of your salary for the next
12 weeks of your leave and will top up your first 6 weeks of SMP (if you are
entitled to it) to 100%. This contribution is called Occupational Maternity Pay
(OMP) . Taken together, this means that you would have 18 weeks of leave on 100%
of your normal salary.

As with all company benefits, you will be entitled to Occupational Maternity Pay
once you are no longer on your probationary period. For the Statutory Maternity
Pay eligibility criteria, please refer to
[government eligibility information for maternity pay](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/eligibility).

After the 18 weeks, your pay will then reduce to the
[government statutory rate for maternity pay](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/pay)
per week for the following 21 weeks.

A person giving birth must take at least the first 2 weeks after the birth as
parental leave.

When you know you are pregnant please tell us as soon as you are comfortable. We
can restrict this knowledge to your Director, Line Manager and People Manager
and it will allow us to check that your working arrangements are safe, help you
manage any pregnancy related sickness and make sure you are paid for time off
for
[antenatal care appointments](https://www.gov.uk/working-when-pregnant-your-rights).
Legally you don’t have to make us aware until 15 weeks before your due date. We
will require a MATB1 certificate ahead of your parental leave, the earlier we
receive this, the earlier we can help with calculations.

Please refer here for further statutory terms around
[pregnancy](https://www.gov.uk/employers-maternity-pay-leave).

#### If you’re adopting

Summary: In most cases, you will be paid 100% of your normal salary for the
first 18 weeks of leave, reduced to the government statutory rate per week for
the following 21 weeks.

##### What you are legally entitled to:

If you are adopting, you’ll probably be eligible for Statutory Adoption Leave
and Statutory Adoption Pay. Statutory Adoption Leave entitles you to 52 weeks of
leave, made up of 26 weeks of Ordinary Adoption Leave and 26 weeks of Additional
Adoption Leave.

Statutory Adoption Pay is paid by the government for up to 39 weeks. The
government will pay you 90% of your normal salary for the first 6 weeks of your
leave. You must have worked for dxw for at least 26 weeks by the week you were
matched with a child and give at least 28 days notice of the adoption leave.
[Proof of adoption](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/how-to-claim) is
required to qualify for Statutory Adoption Pay.

##### What dxw offers in addition:

If you are the primary carer, dxw will pay you 100% of your salary for the next
12 weeks of your leave and top up the first 6 weeks of Statutory Adoption Pay
(if you are entitled to it) to 100%. Taken together, this means that you would
have 18 weeks of leave on 100% of your normal salary.

As with all company benefits, you will be entitled to Occupational Adoption Pay
once you are no longer on your probationary period. For the Statutory Adoption
Pay eligibility criteria, please refer to
[government eligibility information for adoption pay](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/eligibility).

Your pay will then reduce to the
[government statutory rate for adoption pay](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/pay)
per week for the following 21 weeks.

Only 1 person in a couple can take
[statutory adoption leave](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/leave). The
other partner could get secondary carer leave/pay instead (see secondary carer
section below).

If you are taking adoption leave, you are entitled to paid time off work to
attend 5 adoption appointments after you’ve been matched with a child.

#### If you’re having baby through surrogacy

Summary: In most cases, you will be paid 100% of your normal salary for the
first 18 weeks of leave, reduced to the government statutory rate per week for
the following 21 weeks.

##### What you are legally entitled to:

If you are having a baby through surrogacy, you’ll probably be eligible for
Statutory Adoption Leave and Statutory Adoption Pay. Assuming you are entitled
to Statutory Adoption Leave, this entitles you to 52 weeks of leave, made up of
26 weeks of Ordinary Adoption Leave and 26 weeks of Additional Adoption Leave.

Statutory Adoption Pay is paid for up to 39 weeks. The government will pay you
90% of your normal salary for the first six 6 weeks of your leave. You must have
worked for dxw for at least 26 weeks by the week and advise us by way of a
[statutory declaration](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/how-to-claim) at
least 15 weeks before the expected week of birth.

##### What dxw offers in addition:

If you are the primary carer, dxw will pay you 100% of your salary for the next
12 weeks of your leave and top up the first 6 weeks of Statutory Adoption Pay
(if you are entitled to it) to 100%. Taken together, this means that you would
have 18 weeks of leave on 100% of your normal salary.

As with all company benefits, you will be entitled to Occupational Adoption Pay
once you are no longer on your probationary period. For the Statutory Adoption
Pay eligibility criteria, please refer to
[government eligibility information for adoption pay](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/eligibility).

Your pay will then reduce to the
[government statutory rate for adoption pay](https://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/pay)
per week for the following 21 weeks.

Only 1 person in a couple can take adoption leave. The other partner could get
secondary carer leave/pay instead (see secondary carer section below).

#### If you are the secondary carer

As a reminder, the primary carer is the person who will be on parental leave for
the longer period of time. The secondary carer is the person who will be
returning to work first.

The main statutory entitlement for secondary carers is still known as paternity
leave, and that is the only reason we use the term in this context.

Summary: In most cases, you will be paid 100% of your normal salary for 5 weeks.

##### What you are legally entitled to:

If your partner is pregnant, you are adopting, or you are having a baby through
surrogacy, you’ll probably be eligible for Statutory Paternity Leave (SPL) and
Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) or Statutory Adoption Leave and Statutory Adoption
Pay.

SPL may be taken for one or two consecutive weeks, between the date of birth and
56 days afterwards. You can find the
[current SPP rate here](https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave/pay).

##### What dxw offers in addition:

dxw will instead pay you 100% of your normal salary for 5 weeks of parental
leave. You may take these consecutively or separately during the first year from
birth/adoption. If you want to take more than 5 weeks of leave you can use
shared parental leave (see below).

If you are going to become the primary carer for any reason (for example medical
incapacity, or bereavement) within the first 18 weeks from the birth or adoption
of a child, dxw will consider your eligibility for 100% pay in line with our
offer for primary carers. Please approach the People Manager to discuss this.

As with all company benefits, you will be entitled to these once you are no
longer on your probationary period.

#### Shared parental leave

If you’re having a baby, adopting a child, or having a baby through surrogacy,
you may be eligible for Shared Parental Leave and Pay. There are a lot of
factors to eligibility, please refer to the
[government site](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) to review
your particular circumstances.

If you’re eligible and you or your partner ends maternity or adoption leave and
pay (or Maternity Allowance) early, then you can:

- take the rest of the 50 weeks of maternity or adoption leave as Shared
  Parental Leave (SPL)
- take the rest of the 37 weeks of maternity or adoption pay (or Maternity
  Allowance) as Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP). ShPP is paid at the
  [current rate per week](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/what-youll-get)
  or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.

If you’re interested in taking this up, please talk to the People Manager. As
with all company benefits, you will be entitled to these once you are no longer
on your probationary period.

#### Keeping in touch (KIT) days

For pregnancy, adoption and surrogacy, the primary carer has 10 paid KIT days to
take during their parental leave, if they wish to come in for departmental
meetings, events or just to spend some time with the team.

Those on shared parental leave can each work up to 20 days while taking SPL.
These are called
[‘Shared Parental Leave in touch’](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/booking-blocks-of-leave#:~:text=Shared%20Parental%20Leave%20in%20touch,on%20maternity%20or%20adoption%20leave.)
(or SPLIT) days. These days are in addition to the 10 ‘keeping in touch’ (or
KIT) days available to the primary carer.

This won't affect your statutory pay and dxw will top this up so you receive a
normal day's pay for each KIT/SPLIT day.

#### Returning to work

Returning to work is a personal decision - the earliest you can return to work
legally after giving birth is 2 weeks, and you can take up to 52 weeks of
parental leave in total. Speak with your line manager when you have an idea of
how long you would like to take. You are free to change your mind while on
parental leave, as long as 8 weeks notice is given for an intended change to
your return date.

You may wish to consider a phased return when you do come back and this can also
be discussed with your line manager. If for some reason you decide not to return
to work, we do not expect you to pay back any of your parental leave.

#### Holiday accrual

All carers will continue to accrue holiday while they are on parental leave and
any bank holidays that they miss will be added to their holiday entitlement when
they return to work. They can choose to use this annual leave before or after
their parental leave, or have some paid out during their parental leave.

### Childcare Vouchers

The Government closed the Childcare Vouchers scheme to new entrants on 4th
October 2018. This means we are no longer able to add new members to the voucher
scheme with Busy Bees.

The government has introduced new ways to help parents with childcare costs
which you access directly: <https://www.gov.uk/get-tax-free-childcare>

For more information, please speak to the People Manager.

### Flexible working

We aim to offer flexibility for people looking for a part-time role or a role
with flexible hours. Our policy is informed by the way we work and the way we
charge clients for our time.

If you have an alternative working arrangement, you should make sure it’s
reflected in your calendar so the rest of the team can be confident in knowing
when you are and aren’t around.

#### Requesting a change of working arrangement

If you would like to discuss a change to your working pattern, first speak to
your line manager. They will discuss your request, and look at the impact on the
team and your work.

Any changes to working patterns are agreed at our discretion and your line
manager should review them with you from time to time, to check they are still
working for you and dxw.

Once you would like to progress with a new flexible working pattern, please fill
in the
[change of working pattern request form](https://forms.gle/qA1BwvQenqtVzShF8)
and the HR team will make the necessary changes.

#### Normal working pattern

The normal working pattern is 5 days per week, Monday to Friday, and 7 hours per
day (excluding a break for lunch).

#### Part time working

##### Weekly or fortnightly working patterns

We’re happy to talk about a 3 or 4 day week, a 9 day fortnight, or a shorter
working day, where it makes sense for your role. This will depend on the nature
of your role, client, and dxw needs, and the impact on other team members.

Part time roles have their salary and holiday allowances (including bank
holidays) prorated.

For example, when working a 4 day week, the pro rata leave allowance will be 20
days per year of annual leave and 6.5 bank holiday days, giving a total leave
allowance of 26.5 days.

Note that you must book bank holidays that don’t fall on a non-working day as
annual leave in BreatheHR when following this working pattern.

##### Working patterns over longer periods

As an alternative to a working pattern that reduces your days or hours in a
week, we’re happy to talk about working patterns that involve a regular number
of weeks working full-time, followed by some full weeks off.

For example, you might work 4 weeks full-time and have your fifth week off, and
repeat that on a 5 week cycle: 4 weeks on, 1 week off, 4 weeks on, 1 week off,
etc. Alternatively, you might work during school term times, and take the school
holidays off.

This pattern works by reducing your salary and borrowing from the pro rata
holiday and bank holiday allowance, increasing your total time off but reducing
your freely placed holiday allowance. Your annual free holiday allowance might
vary year by year depending on how the weeks and bank holidays land in the year,
so the pattern must have enough free holiday to cover the maximum number of days
you would need off while still allowing you to take some ad hoc holidays
throughout the year.

As a rough guide on how different patterns would impact your salary:

- 7 weeks on, 1 week off: 90-95% FTE salary
- 6 weeks on, 1 week off: 85-90% FTE salary
- 5 weeks on, 1 week off: 85-90% FTE salary
- 4 weeks on, 1 week off: 80-85% FTE salary
- school term on, school holidays off: 70% FTE salary

We are happy to discuss the details and work out the best pattern for you.

#### Compressed hours

Working with compressed hours involves working your full hours in fewer days.
For example, 35 hours in 4 days, from 09:30 to 18:45.

We are happy to discuss compressed hours for all roles but cannot guarantee this
will always be an option. Arrangements must be
[sustainable](#work-at-a-sustainable-pace) for your wellbeing and productivity
and the needs of the role.

For working patterns with an equal number of hours every day, holiday allowance
will be prorated in the same way as for
[part-time roles](#weekly-or-fortnightly-working-patterns). Working patterns
with varied daily hours have annual leave prorated and calculated in hours (231
hours per year). You must book bank holidays that fall on working days as leave
in BreatheHR.

#### Returners’ programme

We offer a [returners’ programme](#returners-program) for people who are
returning to work after a prolonged break. As part of this, we’re able to offer
a phased return to work. If this interests you, please talk to us when applying.

#### Remote working/location

We are able to work successfully in a remote capacity, from our homes. On
occasions, it may be necessary to work from one of our office spaces, a client
location or another location approved by dxw in order to complete a specific
task. It is important that you remain contactable and productive.

#### Changing your working arrangement

If you would like to discuss a change to the standard working pattern, you can
either speak to your line manager or the HR Manager. In this initial
conversation, we will discuss your request, look at the impact on the team and
your work, agree the best time for this arrangement to begin and how it will be
communicated to those necessary.

If you have an alternative working arrangement, you should make sure it’s
reflected in your calendar so the rest of the team can be confident in knowing
when you are and aren’t around.

### Grievances

If you have a grievance about your employment or a complaint about another
member of staff, talk to the Managing Director as soon as possible.

The first step is to discuss the problem to see if it can be quickly resolved.

If this discussion does not satisfactorily resolve the problem, you should put
details of your grievance in writing and send it to the Managing Director. They
will arrange a meeting to discuss the matter, at which you may be accompanied by
a colleague or trade union official. Following this discussion the Managing
Director will provide a written response.

If you disagree with this response or the matter remains unresolved, you may
appeal by responding in writing. A further meeting will be arranged and the
Managing Director will again respond in writing. This decision will be final.

### Disciplinary procedure

If you do something that we feel constitutes misconduct, or your performance in
your job has been poor, we'll talk to you about it. Hopefully, there's just been
some misunderstanding, or some problem that's easy to solve and won't recur.
Formal action will not be taken without careful investigation of the facts.

If we feel it's appropriate, we may verbally warn you, explaining what has been
unacceptable and what you need to do to improve your conduct or performance.

If your conduct or performance fails to improve following a verbal warning, or
if the matter is serious enough that a verbal warning is not appropriate, we may
hold a disciplinary meeting at which you may be accompanied or represented by a
colleague or trade union official. Following this meeting, we may:

- Conclude that no misconduct has taken place, or that there is no poor
  performance
- Issue you with a written warning, which will explain:

  - The nature of the misconduct or poor performance
  - The change to your behaviour or performance that you need to make
  - The time within which the change needs to be made
  - The consequences of not making the change (for example, dismissal)

- In cases of gross misconduct, dismiss you without notice

If you disagree with the outcome of this hearing, you may appeal against the
decision. You must do this in writing. If you do so, your appeal and the
circumstances of your case will be reviewed by a member of staff who has not
been involved in your case before. That member of staff and the Managing
Director will then meet to discuss your case, and will either uphold the outcome
or schedule another disciplinary meeting. dxw's decision following that meeting
will be final.

## Redundancy Policy

The coronavirus pandemic has caused us to look at some of our HR policies - or
more pertinently, the lack of them. It comes at a time where we have grown as a
company, but have not yet put in place all the policies and procedures that a
larger organisation might need.

This policy is being put in place now, whilst we’re not facing any imminent need
to make redundancies - in a classic "fix the roof whilst the sun is shining"
way.

In putting it together, we have considered not just our legal obligations, but
how best to go about doing a hard thing, in line with our dxw values.

### Policy statement

We believe that continuity of employment and job security is important for staff
wellbeing, and for delivering quality work to our clients. We work hard to keep
our sales pipeline healthy. And we plan the future development of dxw carefully
so we can hire the right people at the right time.

However, the future is never certain. Significant changes in our plans or in the
markets we serve, could mean that we need to make a role redundant. If that
happens, we will follow a fair and open process.

This section of the playbook sets out what we’ll do in those circumstances.

### How roles are selected for redundancy

We will take an open, data-led approach in redundancy situations. We might, for
example, find that we need to reduce our unbillable roles to keep profits at a
sustainable level. Or that we need less people in a particular specialism if we
experience a reduction in demand for that type of work.

If a group of people in very similar roles are involved in the redundancy
situation, everyone in the pool will be treated as being at risk and there will
be a selection process. We will publish the selection criteria at the time,
which may include any or all of the following:

- A performance assessment
- Any disciplinary issues having previously arisen
- Adaptability to a new role or way of working
- Attendance record

### The process we’ll follow if we need to make redundancies

The Directors group is responsible for determining any proposed course of action
that involves redundancies. This will be documented, setting out the problem
faced, the options considered, proposed solution, and a plan for implementation.
To ensure this is a fair and robust process, it will be reviewed and agreed with
the Advisory Board/Shareholders, before the following actions are taken:

#### 1. Inform affected employees as soon as their jobs are at risk

We will organise a face-to-face meeting to tell you if your job is at risk of
redundancy. As at the moment we all work remotely, we would organise this by
slack/email, with the meeting held over video conference. If in the future we're
back in an office, we'd do this in person. We will follow up that meeting with a
formal ‘at risk’ notification.

#### 2. Consult staff affected about proposals for change

For staff at risk, with more than two years service, there is a formal legal
consultation period, where we ask you to think about our proposals for change,
and to talk to us if you have any thoughts/ideas about doing things differently.

The length of this consultation period will be no less than a week, but may well
be longer, if for example there is a significant change affecting a number of
colleagues.

There will be at least one consultation meeting with a Director, and with each
person ‘at risk’. More meetings can be arranged if necessary. These meetings
will consider any redeployment opportunities, or other possible measures to
avoid redundancy. You would have the right to be accompanied by a work colleague
or a Trade Union representative.

#### 3. Inform & consult with the wider staff body

There is no legal obligation to consult with the wider staff body (unless there
are more than 20 jobs at risk within a 90 day period), or with at-risk staff
with less than two years service.

However, we would want to be more open than this; and in the interests of
finding solutions, we would want to draw ideas from the widest group of people
possible. So, once the people directly affected have been informed, we will
publish a bikeshed, detailing the proposal for change, and asking for feedback.

An exception to this may arise if an individual role is affected, rather than a
group, as it may cause more discomfort and anxiety by publishing a bikeshed.

#### 4. Decision on proposal

Following consultation, final decisions on the proposal will be taken by the
Directors. Full consideration will be given to anything arising through the
consultation period before a final decision is made on the proposed changes, and
the selection criteria to be used if there is a pool of roles affected. Feedback
will be given to the member of staff whose role is at risk.

Where selection for redundancy is confirmed, the affected employee will be given
written notice of termination in accordance with the terms of their contract.
The letter will also confirm the right to appeal the decision.

#### 5. Appeal

The affected staff members have the right to appeal against the decision to
terminate their employment on the grounds of redundancy. The appeal should be
made in writing within five working days of receipt of the decision letter, and
should be addressed to the Managing Director.

### Time off

Colleagues who have been given notice of redundancy have the right to take
reasonable paid time off to seek other work. This could include registering with
a recruitment agency or attending interviews. Arrangements should be made with
their line manager.

### Notice period

Your notice period is set out in your employment contract. In all cases the
contractual notice period meets or exceeds the statutory notice period legally
required.

### Redundancy pay

dxw will pay statutory redundancy pay to any employee who meets the eligibility
criteria. To be eligible, employees must have been continuously employed for two
complete years, this is a legal requirement that we are unable to change. The
amount of statutory redundancy pay is based on your age and length of service.
Statutory redundancy pay is not subject to tax. Further details here on gov.uk .

Your final salary payment will comprise your normal salary during your notice
period, and any unused holiday entitlement accrued up to your leaving date
(these are both subject to tax and national insurance in the usual way),
together with your statutory redundancy pay.

## Supporting your development and wellbeing

### Line managers

Line management at dxw is not about hierarchy, it’s about providing professional
guidance and support.

Line managers ensure that team members are clear about their roles and
responsibilities at dxw, and how well they are doing at achieving them.

Individuals should be proactive in taking responsibility for their own
development, but line managers will provide advice and support to help team
members meet their agreed short and long term goals.

HR support line managers with advice and guidance on recruitment, onboarding,
probation, performance, sickness and any other specialist knowledge.

You can find out who your line manager is in BreatheHR on the summary section of
your profile page.

#### Line management principles

##### Communicate clearly

Communication is a two-way process and it is important to check understanding
and confidence, and value the other person in decision-making. Explaining the
task and its objectives clearly means people know what’s expected of them and
the part they play. It empowers them to take responsibility and own how they
approach the work.

##### Recognise achievement and celebrate success

A simple ‘thank you’ shows someone that what they have done is appreciated, and
is hugely motivating. Celebrating major, and minor, achievements is an important
part of our culture at dxw. It builds team spirit and morale.

##### Guard our values

Lead by example. The actions and behaviours of line managers must always
demonstrate our dxw values. We should always hold ourselves accountable to our
values, and encourage the same in all of our colleagues, including those we line
manage.

##### Continuous constructive feedback

Find out how each of your team members prefers to receive feedback, and develop
an approach which reflects that. Ongoing positive and constructive feedback is
essential if someone is to feel valued, learn from their experiences and become
better at what they do.

##### Be honest

Being honest means telling the truth and being consistent in what you say and
who you say it to. Telling things as they are, while being sensitive to the
situation and individual, ensures that people know where they stand and will
help to build mutual trust and respect.

##### Wellbeing

Line managers look out for the health and wellbeing of the team. They are
responsible for carrying out dxw's duty of care to its people.

### One-to-ones with your line manager

#### Purpose

For your manager to help you with your personal and professional development,
your wellbeing, and to build a trusting relationship between the two of you.

#### Overview

These meetings are about you; ideally you will feel happy driving the meeting.
If you’re not confident doing this, or are unsure how best to approach it, your
manager will help you to get there.

#### Agenda and topics

Coming to your 1:1s with a list of things you’d like to discuss will help you
make the most of the time. Some things you might find productive to talk about
include:

- **Your career and growth goals:** Don’t assume your manager knows all your
  aspirations. Bring them up in your 1:1s. Your manager understands you won’t
  work for them forever and they want you to have a happy, fulfilling career —
  whatever that means to you. Tip: if you want to talk about your long-term
  goals but feel uneasy about it, ask your manager to do the same.
- **Team improvement:** Have an idea that will help your team to work better?
  Use your manager as a sounding board to help you refine and implement your
  suggestion.
- **Self improvement:** Got a specific thing you’d like some help, coaching or
  feedback on? A technical skill or a soft skill? Your 1:1 is the place to bring
  it up. Remember that you can use the 1:1s that fall between career progression
  reviews to discuss any of the proficiencies you’re currently trying to level
  up on.
- **Personal issues:** Anything going on outside of work that’s affecting your
  wellbeing? Physical or mental illness, bereavement, family issues, stress? The
  more you can tell your manager, the more they can try to help, and make
  accommodations for you at work.
- **Interpersonal issues:** Having problems with a coworker? Your manager can
  help mediate or coach you through how to deal with the issue.
- **Retrospection:** If at any time you feel like your 1:1s aren’t particularly
  productive or helpful, or you’d like to change something about them, don’t
  hesitate to bring this up with your manager.

#### Frequency

1:1s should happen at least once per fortnight. Where possible they’ll be
face-to-face, either in the office or out for a walk, or a coffee. Where that’s
not possible, remote is perfectly fine. There’ll always be a Google Meet link in
the calendar invite.

If you need to reschedule your 1:1, let your manager know at the earliest
opportunity.

#### Meeting length

An hour or so, at least once every two weeks, is a good standard to aim for. If
you meet weekly, a little shorter is fine.

### People and HR Team

The People and HR team is here to support you during your time at dxw. We
provide administrative, wellbeing, learning and development, line manager and
professional support and guidance.

We have a CIPD Level 5 trained HR People Manager and an administrator to support
the HR and Recruitment function - both of whom are Mental Health First Aid
trained. We also have an independent HR advisor to provide additional support
when needed.

We have a public slack channel for general non-sensitive questions,
#help-hr-non-confidential, which is monitored by the team.

We also have a weekly Ask HR slot at 11am on Wednesdays, to provide a regular
opportunity to get advice and support. The door is always open though, so you
can also always book an ad-hoc slot with the HR People Manager to discuss
matters you might not feel able to raise with others in your
[support path](https://playbook.dxw.com/#other-support-paths), or that are
specialist to the HR function in dxw.

The list is not exhaustive but some topics might include:

- Accessibility
- Bereavement
- Contractual matters
- Diversity
- Expenses
- Facilitation/scheduling of conversations with Directors/heads-of
- Grievance & disciplinary matters
- Holiday
- Inclusivity
- Interpersonal issues
- Mental health first aid
- Occupational health issues
- Pay (second line of support after line managers)
- Parental leave
- Probation
- Pensions
- Sickness
- Stress management
- Training and career progression
- Working patterns/locations

### Other support paths

#### Helpers

When you join dxw you will be assigned a helper. This person will work closely
with you for at least your first 4 months. They will do a similar job to you,
help you meet members of the wider team, catch up with you on at least a 3/6/12
week basis to ensure you are receiving everything you need, and will NEVER get
bored of your questions!

If you feel that you’re not getting as much time with your helper as you’d like,
please speak to the People Manager.

As a helper, you will be vital in ensuring you have the regular catch ups - if
you are finding it hard to schedule them, please do talk to Bus Ops.

For more information on being a helper, please see the
[checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QPv7Mg7TTlt_OyLRtstAtPQBcId-ct-uTbWqYnso2jI)
or speak to the People Manager.

#### Buddies

Once you have passed your 4 month probation, we would like you to choose a buddy
within the company to support you.

We recommend this person **doesn’t** work directly with you, someone in a
different role and that you don’t work closely with on projects, as this will
give you a second point of view and a whole new set of experiences to draw on.

This is not mandatory, just recommended and similarly not everyone may wish to
be a buddy - don’t be afraid to ask or say no. It can be reciprocal but doesn’t
have to be. Also, if you feel that a change of buddy would benefit you for
whatever reason or that you’re no longer able to be a buddy, this should also
not be an awkward situation. If you have any concerns, have a chat with the
People Manager.

The buddy system is there to help us all improve, to make sure we're doing the
right kind of work and to check that we're dealing with practical problems we're
facing. It's not line management, so it's not the right place to talk about
holiday, salary, sickness, absence or anything disciplinary. If you need to talk
about those things, talk to the People Manager.

If you want to know more about how the buddy system works, how often to meet and
suggested discussion topics, see the buddy
[crib sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBKwPLFsGWUUzeYAObcFLQJyTPknkLhm2HrbuHwxelU/edit?usp=sharing).
This shouldn’t be a huge time commitment, ideally just a pleasant Friday meet
up.

#### Your delivery lead (for those on client work)

There will be opportunities within the delivery team to raise any issues or
concerns you might have e.g. retrospectives or planning sessions. As well as
this, or if you’d prefer to talk one on one, the delivery lead working on the
project will be available to provide support and guidance.

#### Directors and heads-of

All members of the Directors and heads-of team are here to help answer any
questions you might have. Your own Director and/or Head-of profession or
location is there to provide support on matters relating to dxw and your career
with us, as well as profession specific questions. Similarly, they are here if
you need to escalate any job-related concerns.

#### Our Managing Director, Dave

At dxw, all doors are open if you need to raise a concern or just have a chat -
this includes our MD. Dave is always available to discuss any questions you have
about the company and its future. Equally, if you feel you need to escalate
anything to him, don’t hesitate to get in touch. Dave's diary is open and you
can see it on Google Calendar. If you would like to schedule some time with him,
please feel free to book something.

### Learning and Development

Everybody at dxw gets a yearly learning and development allowance of £1,000 and
up to 4 days.

Read the [Learning and Development guide](/guides/learning-and-development) to
find out more.

Read the [line managers guide](/guides/line-management-guides) to learn about
how to support Learning and Development for your team members.

### Private Slack channels

We encourage everyone at dxw to be open about their identities and the
challenges they experience at work, but sometimes we want to only talk to people
whose experiences more closely resemble our own. To enable that, we have created
a number of private channels:

- \#identity-lgbtqia-plus (contact a member of @identity-lgbtqia-plus-admins to
  join)
- \#identity-neurodiversity-everyone and #identity-neurodiversity-non-management
  (contact a member of @identity-neurodiversity-admins to join)
- \#identity-spoonies (contact a member of @identity-spoonies-admins to join)

Anyone can create a new one by creating the private channel, creating a user
group with at least one volunteer (or asking a Slack admin to do it for you),
and adding it to this list. It's probably a good idea to share that you've
created it in #general.

The membership of those channels is also private to protect those people, and
members of a channel are expected to keep everything in those channels private.

We don't police membership of these channels, and trust everyone to be honest
about their identities. **Don't invite anyone without first asking them if they
want to be invited.**

### Book purchase

If there is a book relevant to your work that you would like to read, make a
request through the #help-purchasing slack channel and the Bus Ops team will buy
it for the library.

### Cycle to work scheme

dxw operates a cycle-to-work scheme, which may allow you to purchase a bicycle
at reduced cost. If you would like to take this up, please register
[on the cycle scheme website](https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/18eb71)

### Eyecare vouchers

dxw provides eyecare for the team via a voucher system run by ASE Corporate
Eyecare Ltd and Boots.

Details of what the wellbeing voucher offers can be found here:
[Eyecare for Wellbeing](https://www.eyecareplans.co.uk/corporate-eyecare/eyecare-for-wellbeing/).

## Hiring new people

### Process

#### Making a plan for hiring

The hiring lead works with HR to create a plan for hiring using
[the hiring doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oN961FE41BWPyrVrPbHCES2D78eB0nbVp7dxZzHkMb8/edit).
This includes planning for each stage of recruitment by doing the following;

- set up the roles in [Applied](https://www.beapplied.com/) where we manage the
  hiring process
- write our sifting and interview questions, and their review guides
- work out who will be part of the hiring team and try to make sure that
  interview panels are diverse

#### Writing a job description

Before deciding to advertise a new job, we try to write an inclusive job
description. The hiring lead will work with heads of professions, the hiring
team, and the HR team to make sure that they’ve gathered what they need and to
get feedback on it. We’ve written about our approach to job descriptions here
[on our blog](https://www.dxw.com/2021/01/how-to-write-inclusive-job-descriptions/).

We always include a salary band in the job description.

Once the hiring lead has a first draft they will put the job description through
[The Gender Decoder](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/) and make relevant
changes before sharing with the Diversity and Inclusion group for a final
review.

We then publish the job advert on
[our careers page](https://www.dxw.com/careers/).

#### Finding people

We sometimes find people through our networks, and share our jobs on Twitter and
LinkedIn.

We also always advertise on specialist jobs boards as relevant. We have a budget
to advertise roles and encourage hiring leads to think about how they could use
this to attract more diverse applicants. We use the following job boards:

- [Hustle Crew](https://www.hustlecrew.co/)
- [Coding Black Females](https://codingblackfemales.com/)
- [Ada's List](https://www.adaslist.co/)
- [Escape the City](https://www.escapethecity.org/)

We typically don’t use recruiters.

We always welcome general applications if there’s not an open vacancy.

#### Reviewing applications

The hiring lead and the hiring team review applications to decide who to take
forward.

We check whether applicants might be able to carry out the job description, and
decide whether to take them to the next stage.

We always inform candidates if they are not being taken to the next stage.

#### Sifting questions

All candidates are required to answer sifting questions as part of their
application. These questions are written by the hiring team and are a chance for
candidates to explain their skillset by answering role specific questions.

#### Interviewing

Interviews are an hour long with two members of the team. Candidates have a
choice of Google Meet or Zoom as their platform to interview on.

dxw interviews are informal. They are a semi-structured conversation. We use
competency-based questions, and look for answers that describe a candidate’s own
experience.

Interviewers should take notes during the interview.

We include time in interviews for candidates to ask questions, whether about
dxw, the role, or the process. We will always try to answer, but we will check
things if we need to and get back to them.

Directly after an interview, the interviewers will add their notes to Applied
without discussing the candidate first. Once all of the interviews are
completed, the hiring team will meet to discuss who will progress to the next
stage.

If a candidate is not being taken to the next stage, we will provide detailed
feedback from the interview.

#### Simulating a work day \[some roles only]

A simulated work day is a 2-3 hour activity based on a real world problem or
task. We use this to make sure that a candidate is capable of taking on a role.
We also find out about how a candidate approaches their work. It also gives the
candidate the chance to meet more people they would be working with and to
understand more about the role, how we work, and the expectations of the job
itself.

The activity itself will be variable dependent on role - for technical roles,
this might involve pairing with one of our developers, or for delivery roles,
running a planning session for a team. The activity will always involve working
in conjunction with someone in a similar role to the one the candidate is
applying for.

We send candidates the task and an explanation at least 24 hours before the work
day, so that they have a chance to read and understand the scope of the
activity, to prepare anything they need to, or to pull out if they don’t feel
like they are a good fit.

At the end of a work day, we ask the candidate to briefly and informally present
their activity to a small group.

After all work days are completed, the hiring team will meet. For candidates who
have not been successful, we will provide detailed feedback from the interview
and work day.

#### Offering the job

When we are ready to offer a job, the HR manager will call and email the
candidate with the details of the offer, including salary and a proposed start
date. If the candidate accepts the offer, we start the onboarding process. If
they have queries, the HR manager will discuss them with them and make
adjustments where possible and appropriate.

Offers are subject to successfully completing eligibility to work in the UK
checks and a background check including BPSS and BS7858. We need to do this
vetting due to restrictions in our client contracts.

## What to expect when joining dxw as an employee

### Onboarding

After you’ve accepted a role at dxw a member of our HR team will be in touch
with you to discuss your laptop, our vetting process and to answer any questions
you may have. On your first day you will receive a welcome trello which will
tell you who your line manager and helper are, things to read and welcome notes
from the team.

### What your first few days will look like

Below is a rough outline of what to expect from your first two days at dxw.

#### Day 1

- Laptop & password set up (led by a tech team member)
- Security chat, password chat & sign documents
- Lunch / Zoom welcome
- HR welcome chat with Passport & P45 check
- Meet your manager

#### Day 2

- Helper welcome chat
- Half-day of self-led training (including any help with software)
- Employee led tasks from your Trello

### Probation

New starters are subject to a probation period of 4 months with dxw having the
option to extend by 2 months. Probationary periods go both ways, it is also a
chance for a new employee to find their feet and dxws way of working. In your
probation meeting your line manager will share feedback that they have gathered
from those you have worked with closely.

### Returners' programme

dxw is proud to offer return to work opportunities for experienced hires who are
looking to re-enter the workplace after an extended period of time away.

We’re running a pilot to begin with to see how this works for us and the people
joining us. We’ll start by taking on one or two people for 3 to 6 months -
depending on the role and circumstances. There’s potential to become a permanent
member of the team at the end of the placement, but this isn’t guaranteed.

Initially this opportunity will only be offered within our London team, with a
view to including our Leeds office as the team there grows.

### Who supports you?

You will be supported by our people team from the point of application.

If you’re invited into our recruitment process, it will consist of a one hour
interview followed by a collaborative activity with the team which will be sent
to you 24 hours in advance so you have time to prepare.

The interview will be an informal, semi-structured conversation where there will
be the opportunity for us to learn more about you and your experience and, just
as importantly, for you to get a feel for what it’s like to work at dxw.

If you join us, you’ll be continuously supported by our people team, a line
manager and a mentor within the same field. You‘ll have regular check ins with
the team where you can speak openly about anything that’s on your mind.

### Client facing role

For client-facing roles we’ll start billing your time back to the client when we
feel the time is right. This will be something we discuss openly during the
recruitment process and through your regular check ins.

### Internal facing roles

We’re also offering internal facing roles, for example, in our busy commercial
and marketing teams who also support our sister company, Tradecraft. These roles
are not billed back to our clients.

If you think this might be for you, please apply through our jobs page.
